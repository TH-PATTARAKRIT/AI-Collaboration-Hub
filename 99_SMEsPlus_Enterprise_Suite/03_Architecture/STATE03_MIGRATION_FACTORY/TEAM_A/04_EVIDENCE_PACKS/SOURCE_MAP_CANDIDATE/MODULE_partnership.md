## 2. Dependencies
- Direct dependencies (manifest): `crm`, `sale`
- Direct dependents in 300-module list (1): `website_crm_partner_assign`
- Direct dependents outside 300 (Community; `DISCOVERED SUPPORTING MODULE — OUTSIDE 300-MODULE DENOMINATOR` if traced) (0): —
- Custom / third-party modules that declare a dependency (name — license only) (0): —

## 3. Capabilities / functions
- Manifest category / summary: Sales/CRM / —
- Inventory of user-facing artifacts (counts): menu items 1, views 9, window actions 3, server actions 0, reports 0, mail templates 0, scheduled jobs 0, wizards 1, web routes 0
- Core/optional/conditional behavior and business meaning of each capability: `UNKNOWN — EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT` (not yet traced)

## 4. Business objects (neutral names) and configuration
- Objects introduced (1): `res.partner.grade` (Partner Grade)
- Objects extended from other modules (6): `product.pricelist`, `sale.order`, `product.template`, `res.company`, `res.config.settings`, `res.partner`
- Company-dependent settings introduced: 0 field(s); company-consistency auto-check declared on 0 object(s)

## 5. Effective extension / override path
Objects introduced here that are extended by other modules (module names only):
- `res.partner.grade` ← Community: `website_crm_partner_assign`; open-license custom/third-party scanned: —
- This module's own extension of other modules' objects: `product.pricelist`, `sale.order`, `product.template`, `res.company`, `res.config.settings`, `res.partner`

## 6. Actions / states / validation / automation / security
- State fields found: none detected by static scan
- Validation: 1 declarative constraint method(s), 0 database-level uniqueness/check declaration(s) (declared in code)
- Automation: no scheduled job declared
- Security: groups declared 0 (—); record rules 0 (of which company-scoped by text 0); access rows 4

## 7. Cross-module handoffs
- Derived from dependents that extend this module's objects (section 5) and from declared dependencies (section 2). Business meaning: `UNKNOWN — EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT` (not yet traced).

## 8. Schema-only confirmation
- Module-specific schema check: **NOT PERFORMED** for this module in this round (general schema findings are in the DB-schema documents; absence of a structure is not proof of absence of a module or its effect).

## 9. Evidence level / V-level / Unknowns
- Actual V-level: **not assigned by this session** (static source evidence only; no runtime).
- Unknown / limitation: effective installed extension set; closed-license extensions; runtime configuration; behavioral semantics of this module (S1 only).
