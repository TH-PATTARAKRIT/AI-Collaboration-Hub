# Source Map (candidate) — `auth_oauth`

> **STATUS:** CLAUDE-REPORTED / PENDING INDEPENDENT VERIFICATION · source revision `19.0.post20260921` · **MODULE-LIST HASH MISMATCH — PENDING BASELINE RECONCILIATION** (module list from on-disk register; not a confirmed denominator) · not runtime proof · Community-core finding = CONDITIONAL ON EFFECTIVE INSTALLED EXTENSION SET

**Trace level:** S1-STATIC-EXTRACT (candidate; behavior semantics not yet traced)

## 1. Identity / classification / provenance
| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Technical name | `auth_oauth` |
| Display name | OAuth2 Authentication |
| Manifest version | None |
| License (manifest) | LGPL-3 |
| Classification | Odoo Community (Core/Optional split not assigned by this session) |
| Register group / mapping | COMM-G01 / MAPPED-CANDIDATE (register on-disk; unverified baseline) |
| Manifest sha256 (16) | `70b72cdbfa35051e` |

## 2. Dependencies
- Direct dependencies (manifest): `base`, `web`, `base_setup`, `auth_signup`
- Direct dependents in 300-module list (0): —
- Direct dependents outside 300 (Community; `DISCOVERED SUPPORTING MODULE — OUTSIDE 300-MODULE DENOMINATOR` if traced) (0): —
- Custom / third-party modules that declare a dependency (name — license only) (0): —

## 3. Capabilities / functions
- Manifest category / summary: Hidden/Tools / —
- Inventory of user-facing artifacts (counts): menu items 1, views 3, window actions 1, server actions 0, reports 0, mail templates 0, scheduled jobs 0, wizards 1, web routes 2
- Core/optional/conditional behavior and business meaning of each capability: `UNKNOWN — EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT` (not yet traced)

## 4. Business objects (neutral names) and configuration
- Objects introduced (1): `auth.oauth.provider` (OAuth2 provider)
- Objects extended from other modules (3): `ir.config_parameter`, `res.users`, `res.config.settings`
- Company-dependent settings introduced: 0 field(s); company-consistency auto-check declared on 0 object(s)

## 5. Effective extension / override path
- No direct extension (`_inherit`) of this module's own objects found in Community modules or in open-license custom/third-party modules scanned (`ABSENCE`; text-pattern scan, not MRO analysis; closed-license modules not readable). NOTE: modules listed as dependents in section 2 may still hook into behavior through other modules' objects — dependency is not the same as extension.
- This module's own extension of other modules' objects: `ir.config_parameter`, `res.users`, `res.config.settings`

## 6. Actions / states / validation / automation / security
- State fields found: none detected by static scan
- Validation: 0 declarative constraint method(s), 1 database-level uniqueness/check declaration(s) (declared in code)
- Automation: no scheduled job declared
- Security: groups declared 0 (—); record rules 0 (of which company-scoped by text 0); access rows 1

## 7. Cross-module handoffs
- Derived from dependents that extend this module's objects (section 5) and from declared dependencies (section 2). Business meaning: `UNKNOWN — EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT` (not yet traced).

## 8. Schema-only confirmation
- Module-specific schema check: **NOT PERFORMED** for this module in this round (general schema findings are in the DB-schema documents; absence of a structure is not proof of absence of a module or its effect).

## 9. Evidence level / V-level / Unknowns
- Actual V-level: **not assigned by this session** (static source evidence only; no runtime).
- Unknown / limitation: effective installed extension set; closed-license extensions; runtime configuration; behavioral semantics of this module (S1 only).
